### Hi there, I am Dawei Zhong 👋

I'm a Physics PhD student at the 📚✌️ University of Southern California ✌️📚 working on ⚛️ Quantum Computing ⚛️. To be specific, I am trying to reduce the noise in current quantum computers and exploit their capacity to finish scientific simulation tasks. 

You can find useful resources about quantum computing at
