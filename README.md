### Hi there, I am Dawei Zhong ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my coding space!

Iâ€™m currently a Physics PhD student at University of Southern California. My previous research focus on astronomy and cosmology, and I change my research interest to quantum computation recently. I am looking forward to collaborate on anything we are both interested. 

For most of my repository, I organize them in the following way

* `resource` as prefix: some useful resource
* `research` as prefix: about my research 
* `project` as prefix: projects as exercise or personal interest
* Not include above prefix: please read the `README.md` file of a certain repository for details

ðŸ“« Please feel free to contact me via

* Email: [daweiz@usc.edu](mailto:daweiz@usc.edu)
